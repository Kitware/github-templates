github-templates
================

A collection of materials to use in new Kitware GitHub repositories.

Files
-----

* **README-template.md** - An example template for creating engaging, informative content for the front page of your repository

* **CONTRIBUTING-template.md** - Most projects should include this file; it is displayed to users when they open a pull request or new issue, and explains the rules and suggested modes of making contributions.  The file should be clear, welcoming, and include links to other resources such as mailing lists, etc.

* *Licensing* - All projects should include a license file called **LICENSE**.  GitHub offers to supply one when a new repository is created.  Most projects at Kitware use the three-clause BSD license, but the choice of license obviously depends on the project.
